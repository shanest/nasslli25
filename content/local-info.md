# Accommodations

## On-campus accommodation

You can book rooms in [McCarty Hall](https://hfs.uw.edu/Conference-Guest-Rooms/McCarty-Hall) at the University of Washington using [this reservation link](https://washington.irisregistration.com/Form/6820).  The deadline to reserve a room is May 30, 2025 (or June 15, but with a $25 late fee), but we would appreciate you registering as soon as possible if you know you will use this option.  McCarty Hall is a modern residence hall with single and double occupancy rooms, located on the north side of campus.  The lodging unfortunately has non-flexible dates, with a check-in on June 22 and check-out on June 28, as well as a mandatory purchase of dining credits on UW campus.  More information is available on the registration link above.
