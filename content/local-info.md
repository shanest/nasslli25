# Accommodations

NASSLLI attendees will be able to reserve lodging in modern residency halls on the University of Washington campus.  While we are waiting for the rates to be finalized for the upcoming year, they will be roughly **$75 per person per night** for a double-occupancy room or **$125 per person per night** for a single-occupancy room.  While exact numbers and a registration form will be posted when available, you can get an understanding for what the options will look like from [this page](https://hfs.uw.edu/Summer-Conference-Center/Conference-Accommodations).
