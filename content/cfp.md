# General Information

It is our pleasure to invite course proposals for the 2025 North American Summer School in Logic, Language, and Information (NASSLLI), to be held **June 23–27, 2025**, hosted by the University of Washington, Seattle.

NASSLLI provides outstanding interdisciplinary educational opportunities to graduate students and advanced undergraduates in logic, linguistics, computer science, cognitive science, and philosophy; it offers a venue where students and researchers from one domain can learn approaches, frameworks, and tools from related disciplines to apply to their own work.

Courses should aim to be accessible to an interdisciplinary, graduate level audience. They may bridge multiple fields or focus on a single topic area; interdisciplinary surveys and introductions to new research are both welcome in any subject matter that fits within the broad outlines of NASSLLI’s stated domain.

Recent iterations of NASSLLI can be found at the following links:

- [2022 at USC](https://ml-la.github.io/nasslli2022/)
- [2020 online due to COVID](https://www.brandeis.edu/nasslli2020/)
- [2018 at CMU](https://www.cmu.edu/nasslli2018/)

Courses typically meet for approximately 90 minutes each day, Monday through Friday; in addition, "bootcamp" tutorials are sometimes offered on the weekend before the main classes begin.

More details can be found below. We hope you will consider submitting a course proposal and distributing this call widely throughout relevant networks!

**Submission deadline:** November 12, 2024.

**Proposal submission:** [https://openreview.net/group?id=NASSLLI/2025/Conference](https://openreview.net/group?id=NASSLLI/2025/Conference)

All the best,

# Proposal Requirements

Course proposals should be concise and include:

- Title & instructor(s)
- Outline of proposed course content (up to 500 words)
- Brief statement of teaching experience (especially in interdisciplinary settings)
- Anticipated travel costs, including whether / to what extent this may be self-funded (see below)
- Any special equipment/requirements/accommodations that may be needed
- Submit proposals using OpenReview. (Please note that new profiles created without an institutional email will go through a moderation process that can take up to two weeks; new profiles created with an institutional email will be activated automatically.)

# Funding

We hope to reimburse reasonable travel expenses for up to two instructors per course. In addition, we will make available appropriate accommodation for participating faculty, and aim to cover the costs for instructors utilizing this accommodation (again, up to two instructors per course). However, the availability of reimbursement will depend on overall funding, which is still uncertain. Thus, we strongly encourage all instructors to fund their own travel and accommodation if this is feasible, since this will allow us to use more of our funding for student scholarships and for reimbursement for instructors without funding sources.
