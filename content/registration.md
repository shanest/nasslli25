# Registration Rates

- Online only: $100.  Note: while NASSLLI is fundamentally an in-person event, and the relationships built during in-person attendance are often formative and long-lasting, we do also want to make the program available as widely as possible.  To that end, we plan for the lectures for the majority of courses will be broadcast on Zoom, which online-only attendees will be able to access.

- Postdoc or temporary faculty: $250
- Tenure-track / permanent faculty: $300
- Industry professional: $400
